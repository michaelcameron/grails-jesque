Grails Jesque
=============

Jesque is an implementation of [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) in [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html).
It is fully-interoperable with the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) ([Coffee-Resque](https://github.com/technoweenie/coffee-resque)) implementations.

The grails jesque plugin uses [jesque](https://github/gresrun/jesque) and the grails redis plugin as a dependency.
While it uses jesque for the core functionality it makes it groovier to use in grails.

There is also a grails [jesque-web](https://github.com/michaelcameron/grails-jesque-web) plugin initially ported from the [jesque-web](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque-web) spring-mvc app, which itself was based on the Sinatra web app resque-web in [resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque).
Either UI will allow you to see what's in your queues and view and re-process failed messages.

How do I use it?
----------------
Add the jesque plugin to grails, it will automatically pull in jesque with it's dependencies, and the grails redis plugin.

```bash
grails install-plugin jesque
```

You must also have [redis](http://redis.io) installed in your environment.


Example to enqueue

```groovy

class BackgroundJob {
    def someOtherService //auto-wiring supported

    def perform( arg1, arg2 ) {
        def domainObject = DomainClass.get(arg1) //GORM supported
        domainObject.message = arg2
        domainObject.save()
    }
}

class SomeOtherClass {
    def jesqueService

    def doWorkAsync() {
        jesqueService.enqueue( 'myQueueName', BackgroundJob.simpleName, 1, 'hi there')
    }
}
```

Workers can be started manually by calling

```groovy
    jesqueService.startWorker( 'myQueueName', BackgroundJob.simpleName, BackgroundJob )
```

or automatically upon start-up with the following config

```xml
grails {
    jesque {
        workers {
            someNameForYourWorkerPool {
                workers = 3 //defaults to 1
                queueNames = 'myQueueName' //or a list
                jobTypes = [(BackgroundJob.simpleName):BackgroundJob]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The redis pool used is configured in the [redis](https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-redis) plugin:

```xml
grails {
    redis {
        host = localhost //default
        prot = 6379 //default
    }
}
```

Jobs
----
Jobs should be placed in grails-app\jobs similar to the [Quartz](http://grails.org/Quartz+plugin) plugin.
However, to not clash with quartz, and to retain similarties with resque, the method to execute must be called perform.

You can run the script create-jesque-job to create a shell of a job for you automatically.  The
following will create a BackgroundJob in the ${grails-app}\jobs folder.

```bash
grails create-jesque-job package.Background
```

Unit and integration tests will also automatically be created.  If you have spock installed and listed in your application.properties
it will create an integration specification instead of a grails integration test.

Roadmap
----
* Ability to execute methods on services without creating a job object
* Wrap above ability automatically with annotation and dynamically creating a method with the same name + "Async" suffix
